    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller
      objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
    <p>List of the 9 Planets in order from the sun:</p>

      <h2>The Sun</h2>
      <p>The Sun is the largest object within our solar system, comprising 99.8% of the system's mass. The Sun is located at the center of our solar system, and Earth orbits 93 million miles away from it. Though massive, the Sun still isn't as large
        as other types of stars. It's classified as a yellow dwarf star.</p>

      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the sun in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. </p>

    <div class="venus">
      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked
        eye in broad daylight.</p>

    <div class="Earth">
      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by
        lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere.</p>

    <div class="Mars">
      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet</p>

    <div class="Jupiter">
      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined</p>

    <div class="Satern">
      <h2>Satern</h2>
      <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with
        its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive</p>

      <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus and father of Cronus. It has the third-largest planetary radius and
        fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.</p>

    <div class="Neptune">
      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly
        more massive than its near-twin Uranus. </p>

      <h2>Pluto</h2>
      <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from
        the Sun. </p>
